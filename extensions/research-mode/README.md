# Research Mode Extension

Read-only research behavior for PI when user intent is investigation, not editing.

## Rules
- Do not modify files
- Do not run destructive shell commands
- Prefer retrieval-first answers with source URLs
- For time-sensitive questions, force recency filters
- For low-confidence outputs, state uncertainty clearly

## Activation
- Manual: "enter research mode"
- Implicit: queries that ask for analysis, web lookup, comparison, or synthesis

## Exit
- Manual: "exit research mode"
- Implicit: user explicitly asks for edits or implementation
