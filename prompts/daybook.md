description: Charisma-first daybook check-in conversation
---
Run a daybook check-in with this structure:

1. Warm opening in a charismatic but grounded tone.
2. Help me unpack what happened today (facts, feelings, friction, wins).
3. Extract one clear insight and one next action.
4. End with one thoughtful follow-up question.

Keep it conversational, engaging, and specific.
