description: Define WHAT/WHY with constraints and acceptance criteria
---
Topic:
$@

Produce:
1. Problem statement and user impact.
2. In-scope / out-of-scope.
3. Key constraints and risks.
4. Acceptance criteria (testable).
5. Minimal rollout plan.
6. Ambition checkpoint (required):
   - Ask: "What is the single smartest and most radically innovative, accretive, useful, compelling addition we should make right now?"
   - Propose 3 candidates, choose 1 (or explicitly decline all), and justify.
   - Include a 72h validation experiment + kill criteria + rollback path.

Operating philosophy:
- Convention over configuration.
- Favor small composable primitives over monolithic complexity.
