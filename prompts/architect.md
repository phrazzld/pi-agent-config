description: Design HOW to implement with options and tradeoffs
---
Problem:
$@

Deliver:
1. Current-state summary.
2. 2-3 options with tradeoffs.
3. Chosen design and why.
4. Module boundaries and interfaces.
5. Migration and rollback path.
6. Ambition checkpoint (required):
   - Ask: "What is the single smartest and most radically innovative, accretive, useful, compelling addition we should make right now?"
   - Propose 3 candidates, select 1 accretive addition (or explicitly reject all), with rationale.
   - Include a 72h validation experiment + kill criteria.

Operating philosophy:
- Convention over configuration.
- Unix-style composition: small focused components with clear contracts.
